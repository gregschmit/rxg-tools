# Token Portal

This is an example of a portal that facilitates the generation of tokens for internet access. This does require the user to be an administrator, but they do not need any permissions. There are some reasonable defaults built-in and the account options are hard-coded.

# TODO

 - Auto-detect account group options
 - Back button after viewing the tokens in HTML
