# Curls

These are fairly simple `sh` scripts that primarily use `curl` to interact with the rXg's RESTful API.

## Usage

Use `cp` to copy `_init_example.sh` to `_init.sh` and edit the variables inside to match the rXg you want to connect to.

Then, you can use the shell scripts, which will import the information in `_init.sh`.
