# Greg's rXg Tools

This is a collection of useful tools (scripts, portals) I use in conjunction with RGNets' rXg platform.

In general, Ruby scripts are intended to be copied to the target rXg and run from the user's home directory. Shell scripts usually interact with the API and so can be run on any machine with TCP/IP connection to the target rXg.
